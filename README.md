Quotas is a different kind of time management app.

Normally time management is done by setting time slots where specific tasks
will be completed. This apporach leaves little to no room for unexpected events
nor any room for flexability. 

Quotas is a program that manages time using tasks rather than time slots. Using, 
like the name suggests, quotas for specific tasks and activities we can create
a variable, and flexible system of time management.
